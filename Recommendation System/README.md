### A recommender system, or a recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications. (source - Wikipedia)

## Mainly three types of recommendation systems in machine learning based on filtering are used to suggest product and services to the consumers.

1. Content Filtering

2. Collaborative Filtering

3. Hybrid Filtering

### 1. Content Filtering:

In this algorithm, we try finding items look alike. Once we have item look like matrix,we can easily recommend alike items to a customer, who has purchased any item from the store.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering:

Here, we try to search for look alike customers and offer products based on what his/her lookalike has chosen.This algorithm is very effective but takes a lot of time and resources.

### 3. Hybrid Filtering (Content Filtering + Collaborative Filtering):

Both Content Filtering & Collaborative Filtering is used for the purpose. you-tube uses this algorithm for their strong recommendation system.

### **Collaborative Filtering**

Our content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.

Also, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she/he is.

Therefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers.
It is basically of two types:-

*  **User based filtering**-  These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity.
This filtering technique can be illustrated with an example. In the following matrixes, each row represents a user, while the columns correspond to different movies except the last one which records the similarity between that user and the target user. Each cell represents the rating that the user gives to that movie. Assume user E is the target.

Since user A and F do not share any movie ratings in common with user E, their similarities with user E are not defined in Pearson Correlation. Therefore, we only need to consider user B, C, and D. Based on Pearson Correlation, we can compute the following similarity.

From the above table we can see that user D is very different from user E as the Pearson Correlation between them is negative. He rated Me Before You higher than his rating average, while user E did the opposite. Now, we can start to fill in the blank for the movies that user E has not rated based on other users.

Although computing user-based CF is very simple, it suffers from several problems. One main issue is that usersâ€™ preference can change over time. It indicates that precomputing the matrix based on their neighboring users may lead to bad performance. To tackle this problem, we can apply item-based CF.

* **Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does. The following table shows how to do so for the movie Me Before You.

It successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is ***scalability***. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is O(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, ***sparsity*** is another concern. Take a look at the above table again. Although there is only one user that rated both Matrix and Titanic rated, the similarity between them is 1. In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.
